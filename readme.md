# cntx-stories

> **Note**: This project may be integrated into [cntx-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cntx-ui) in the future as part of a broader context management ecosystem for AI interactions. It may become a module within cntx-ui or remain standalone - this is still being evaluated.

A structured AI agent workflow framework that organizes AI interactions into **Stories** ‚Üí **Activities** ‚Üí **Steps**. Build complex AI workflows with persistence, state management, and both CLI and web interfaces.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cntx-stories
```

## Usage

The package provides three CLI aliases:
- `cntx-stories` - Full package name
- `stories` - Short alias  
- `strs` - Ultra-short alias

```bash
# All of these work the same:
cntx-stories init
stories init
strs init
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize with example stories
stories init

# List all available AI agents
stories agent list

# Add a custom AI agent
stories agent add myai "myai-command" --args "{prompt}"

# Switch to an agent
stories agent switch claude

# List all stories
stories list

# Run a story
stories run website-builder

# Launch web UI
stories ui
```

}
```

## Original Abstract

The core concept behind cntx-stories is to create structured, reusable workflows for AI agent interactions with clear rules, expected outcomes, and persistent state tracking. 

The framework organizes work into hierarchical units: Stories contain Activities, which contain Steps. Each level maintains state and expected outcomes that can be defined as defaults but modified throughout execution. A SQLite database stores all workflow definitions and execution state, while a TypeScript/React frontend provides comprehensive CRUD operations for managing these components.

The system delivers context-aware instructions at each execution step, ensuring workflows progress toward their defined outcomes. Stories are organized in a folder structure where each story contains its activities, allowing for easy management and version control.

The CLI interface reads agent instructions and enables listing, executing, and managing stories through a pre-defined process. Agents understand how to perform each task within an activity, including automatic database updates to track progress and maintain state consistency throughout the workflow execution.

## Vision

We are building a structured, scriptable framework for AI agent execution with traceable, editable logic ‚Äî almost like a programmable adventure engine for agents, where ‚Äú**Stories**‚Äù are composed of ‚Äú**Activities**‚Äù and each activity consists of **Steps**, **State**, and **Expected Outcomes**.

Here‚Äôs how we can lay out this system clearly:

---

## üß† Core Taxonomy

### 1. **Story**

- A high-level workflow or goal (e.g., ‚ÄúBuild a website,‚Äù ‚ÄúAudit codebase‚Äù).
- Composed of multiple **Activities**.
- Has `initialState`, `expectedOutcomes`, and `completionCriteria`.

### 2. **Activity**

- A unit of work toward the story's goal (e.g., ‚ÄúScaffold frontend,‚Äù ‚ÄúRun linter‚Äù).
- Composed of **Steps**.
- Has its own `state`, `instructions`, `promptTemplate`, and `outcomeTracker`.

### 3. **Step**

- The smallest unit: a single prompt-execution/evaluation.
- Optionally contains:

  - `inputRequest` (what it needs),
  - `agentPrompt` (from `promptLib`),
  - `stateUpdates`,
  - `checkOutcome`.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Folder and DB Structure

### File Layout

```
/stories/
  website-builder/
    story.json
    activities/
      scaffold-frontend.json
      run-linter.json
      write-tests.json
```

Each file defines a Story or Activity with structured JSON or YAML.

### SQLite Schema

```sql
-- Stories
CREATE TABLE stories (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  initial_state JSON,
  expected_outcomes JSON,
  completion_criteria TEXT
);

-- Activities
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  story_id TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  instructions TEXT,
  prompt_template TEXT,
  state JSON,
  expected_outcome TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(story_id) REFERENCES stories(id)
);

-- Steps
CREATE TABLE steps (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  activity_id TEXT,
  order_index INTEGER,
  prompt TEXT,
  input_request TEXT,
  state_update_logic TEXT,
  outcome_check TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY(activity_id) REFERENCES activities(id)
);
```

---

## üß™ CLI + Agent Runtime

### `agent-instructions.md`

Contains top-level directives for the agent runtime:

```md
# Agent Instructions

You can run stories and follow each activity step-by-step.

## Available Commands

- `list stories`
- `run story <story-id>`
- `continue story <story-id>`
- `run activity <activity-id>`

Each activity step will provide:

- A minimal prompt from the promptLib.
- State updates stored in SQLite.
- Checks to determine if the expected outcome was met.
```

### Example CLI usage:

```sh
$ agent list stories
1. Website Builder

$ agent run story website-builder
‚û° Starting activity: scaffold-frontend
üßæ Step 1: Generate Tailwind layout...
...
```

---

## üß∞ PromptLib

A small TS module or DB table that maps reusable prompt types:

```ts
{
  "generate-ui": "Given the following spec, generate minimal HTML/TSX with Tailwind:",
  "lint-code": "Given the code below, check for lint issues and suggest fixes:",
  ...
}
```

---

## üñ• Frontend (React/TS)

A simple CRUD UI:

- **Story Manager**: List/create/edit stories
- **Activity Editor**: Add/edit steps, state updates, prompt templates
- **Step Debugger**: Simulate agent responses, validate expected outcomes
- **State Viewer**: See live progress of a running story

---

## ‚úÖ Flow Summary

1. Define story and its activities (via UI or JSON/YAML).
2. Agent CLI runs with context from `agent-instructions.md`.
3. Each activity step is executed:

   - Pulls prompt from `promptLib`
   - Passes state context
   - Agent responds
   - Step logic updates state
   - Step verifies outcome met

4. SQLite tracks all progress.

---
